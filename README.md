## üõ† Usage

### 1. Add to your PATH

Make sure the `notes` script is executable and located in a directory that's part of your system's `PATH`.

You can create the script like this:

```bash
# ~/bin/notes
#!/bin/bash

# Replace /full/path/to/cli.py with the actual path to your script
exec python3 /full/path/to/cli.py "$@"
```

Make it executable:

`chmod +x ~/bin/notes`

Make sure ~/bin exists:

`mkdir -p ~/bin`

Add the script directory to your shell config (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc.):

`source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc`
